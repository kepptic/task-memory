# /task-memory - Task Planning & Context Preservation

Persistent task tracking with documentation. Work survives context resets.

---

## Critical Rules

### Rule 1: NO WORK WITHOUT TASK

Before writing code, editing files, or implementing anything:

**STOP. Create task in tasks.md FIRST.**

### Rule 2: STATUS FIELD IS AUTHORITATIVE

The `**Status**:` field determines task state. The UI reads this field and auto-reorganizes mismatches.

**To change status:**

- ✅ Change `**Status**: todo` → `**Status**: in-progress` → `**Status**: done`
- ✅ Add `**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD` when starting
- ✅ Add `**Finished**: YYYY-MM-DD` when completing
- ✅ Optionally move task block to matching section for file readability

**Auto-Reorganization:** If Status doesn't match section, the UI auto-fixes on load. For file clarity when editing directly, move blocks to their matching sections.

### Rule 3: PRESERVE RESEARCH (2-Action Rule)

After every 2 visual operations (screenshots, PDFs, web searches):

**STOP. Create/update notes file NOW.**

### Rule 4: NEVER REPEAT FAILURES

```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```

Track what you tried. Mutate the approach. Log errors.

### Rule 5: PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Before writing ANY code, complete this checklist:

```
☐ Read relevant files (identify them first)
☐ Search for similar implementations in codebase
☐ Identify existing patterns to follow
☐ Review known gotchas for this area
☐ Document findings in task Notes
```

**Why:** Skipping this causes pattern violations, duplicate code, and preventable bugs.

### Rule 6: SELF-CRITIQUE BEFORE DONE

Before marking a task done, verify:

```
☐ Code quality: No hardcoded values, proper error handling
☐ Pattern compliance: Follows existing codebase conventions
☐ Completeness: All subtasks genuinely finished
☐ No regressions: Existing functionality preserved
```

**If any check fails:** Fix before marking done. Never defer issues to "later."

## Multi-File Projects

Some projects split tasks across multiple kanban files — for example, one
per domain (`api`, `admin`, `public`) or per workspace in a monorepo.
The hook supports this via the `task_files_glob` field in
`.task-memory.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "task_files_glob": "docs/todo/*/tasks.md"
}
```

When set, the hook:

- Discovers every file matching the glob (sorted for deterministic output).
- On `SessionStart`, lists **all** in-progress tasks from every file, each
  annotated with its parent-directory label so you can see at a glance
  which file owns what:
  ```
  📋 In-progress (3):
    • TASK-491 | Our Crew page redesign… [2/5] (admin)
    • TASK-501 | API rate limit… [0/3] (api)
    • TASK-512 | Public marketing hero… [4/4] (public)
  ```
- Routes log appends (`WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Bash` errors) to whichever
  file owns the referenced `TASK-XXX`.
- Reorganizes the **specific** file that was edited (no cross-file moves).
- Only nags on Write/Edit when the edited file is the one holding the
  active task — unrelated edits don't re-print the task context.

Existing single-file projects don't need any config — the old behavior
(`planning/tasks.md`) is unchanged when `task_files_glob` is absent.

An optional `todowrite_mirror_file` field pins TodoWrite mirroring to one
file; otherwise the first file in the glob receives the mirror section.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create Task

**Location:** `planning/tasks.md`

**Get next ID:**

```markdown
<!-- Config: Last Task ID: XXX -->
```

Read current ID, increment by 1.

**Task Template:**

```markdown
### TASK-XXX | [Brief Title]

**Priority**: [🔴 Critical|🟠 High|🟡 Medium|🟢 Low] | **Category**: [Feature|Bug|Docs|Research] | **Status**: todo | **Assigned**: @user
**Workflow**: [Feature|Refactor|Investigation|Migration|Simple] | **Complexity**: [Simple|Standard|Complex]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD | **Started**: | **Finished**:
**Tags**: #tag1 #tag2

[Description of what needs to be done]

**Subtasks**:

- [ ] Phase 1: First subtask
- [ ] Phase 2: Second subtask (depends: Phase 1)
- [ ] Phase 3: Third subtask (depends: Phase 2)

**Pre-Work Checklist**:

- [ ] Read relevant files
- [ ] Searched for similar implementations
- [ ] Identified patterns to follow
- [ ] Reviewed known gotchas

**Notes**:

**Visual Operations Log**:

**Errors Log**:
```

**Date Fields:**
| Field | When to Set | Required For |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Created** | When task is created | All tasks |
| **Started** | When Status → in-progress | in-progress, done |
| **Finished** | When Status → done | done |

**Dependencies Syntax:**

- Single: `(depends: Phase 1)`
- Multiple: `(depends: Phase 1, Phase 2)`

**Workflow Types:**

| Type              | When to Use                   | Pipeline Behavior                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Feature**       | New functionality, multi-step | Full planning, dependency tracking |
| **Refactor**      | Code restructuring            | Add → Migrate → Remove stages      |
| **Investigation** | Debugging, root cause         | Reproduce → Investigate → Fix      |
| **Migration**     | Data/schema changes           | Backup → Transform → Validate      |
| **Simple**        | Quick fixes, single file      | Minimal overhead                   |

**Complexity Levels:**

| Level        | Scope                        | Planning Required              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Simple**   | 1-2 files, single concern    | Minimal subtasks               |
| **Standard** | 3-10 files, 1-2 services     | Detailed subtasks with phases  |
| **Complex**  | 10+ files, multiple services | Notes file, extensive planning |

**Update config after creating:**

```markdown
<!-- Config: Last Task ID: XXX -->  ← Increment this
```

### Step 2: Start Work (Change Status)

**Before starting**, complete the Pre-Work Checklist in the task, then:

1. **Update the Status field**: `todo` → `in-progress`
2. **Add Started date**
3. **(Optional)** Move task block to "In Progress" section for file clarity

```markdown
# Update Status field and add Started date:

**Priority**: High | **Category**: Feature | **Status**: in-progress
**Created**: 2026-01-13 | **Started**: 2026-01-13

**Pre-Work Checklist**:

- [x] Read relevant files
- [x] Searched for similar implementations
- [x] Identified patterns to follow
- [x] Reviewed known gotchas
```

**Status field is authoritative.** The UI auto-reorganizes mismatches on load. Moving blocks is optional but recommended when editing files directly.

**DO NOT skip the pre-work checklist.** This prevents pattern violations and duplicate code.

### Step 3: Work and Update

Mark subtasks as completed:

```markdown
**Subtasks**:

- [x] Completed subtask
- [x] Another completed
- [ ] Still pending
```

Add progress to Notes:

```markdown
**Notes**:

- Investigated issue
- Found root cause in file.ts:42
- Implemented fix
```

Log errors as they occur:

```markdown
**Errors Log**:
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Module not found | 1 | Installed missing dep |
| Type mismatch | 2 | Fixed interface |
```

### Step 4: Self-Critique & Complete Task

**Before marking done**, run this self-critique:

```
☐ Code quality: No hardcoded values, proper error handling?
☐ Pattern compliance: Follows existing codebase conventions?
☐ Completeness: All subtasks genuinely finished?
☐ No regressions: Existing functionality preserved?
☐ Insights documented: Patterns/gotchas recorded in Notes?
```

**If any check fails:** Fix before marking done. Never defer issues.

**When ALL checks pass:**

1. **Update the Status field**: `in-progress` → `done`
2. **Add Finished date**
3. **(Optional)** Move task block to "Done" section for file clarity

```markdown
# Update Status field and add Finished date:

**Priority**: High | **Category**: Feature | **Status**: done
**Created**: 2026-01-13 | **Started**: 2026-01-13 | **Finished**: 2026-01-13
```

**Status field is authoritative.** The UI auto-reorganizes mismatches on load.

### Step 5: Commit with Task Reference

```bash
git commit -m "feat: description (TASK-XXX)"
```

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

| Attempt | Action                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Diagnose & fix - identify root cause, apply targeted fix, log to Errors Log            |
| 2       | Alternative approach - different method/tool/library, NEVER repeat same failing action |
| 3       | Broader rethink - question assumptions, search for solutions, update plan              |
| After 3 | Escalate to user - explain what you tried, share specific error, ask for guidance      |

**Key principle:** Error recovery is a signal of true agentic behavior.

---

## Read vs Write Decision Matrix

| Situation             | Action                 | Reason                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Just wrote a file     | DON'T read             | Content still in context      |
| Viewed image/PDF      | Write notes NOW        | Multimodal → text before lost |
| Browser returned data | Write to notes         | Screenshots don't persist     |
| Starting new phase    | Read plan/notes        | Re-orient if context stale    |
| Error occurred        | Read relevant file     | Need current state to fix     |
| Resuming after gap    | Read tasks.md + notes/ | Recover full state            |

---

## Task Documentation (notes/)

The `planning/notes/` folder stores task-related documentation that persists across sessions:

- **Research findings** - Visual analysis, web research, documentation review
- **Audit results** - Security audits, performance audits, accessibility checks
- **Code review notes** - Review feedback, suggested changes, approval notes
- **Meeting notes** - Decisions made, action items, stakeholder input
- **Decision logs** - Architecture decisions, trade-off analysis, rationale
- **Test results** - Test analysis, failure investigation, coverage reports

### The 2-Action Rule

After every 2 visual operations, save to notes immediately:

```
Action 1: View screenshot
Action 2: Read PDF
→ STOP: Create planning/notes/TASK-XXX.md NOW
```

**Why:** Screenshots, PDFs, browser results don't persist in context. Text in markdown persists forever.

### When to Create Notes

**Trigger after 2 of:**

- Screenshots (Claude in Chrome, browser automation)
- PDFs or images
- Search results
- Documentation pages
- Code reviews
- Any content worth preserving

### Notes File Template

**Location:** `planning/notes/TASK-XXX.md`

Key sections: Summary, Analysis, Patterns Discovered, Gotchas, Decisions, Resources, Action Items

- **Patterns** = "Do this" - reusable solutions
- **Gotchas** = "Don't do this" - mistakes to avoid

Link notes to task: `**Notes**: Documentation in notes/TASK-XXX.md`

## Status Values

| Status        | Description | Required Fields            |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `todo`        | Not started | Created                    |
| `in-progress` | Active work | Created, Started           |
| `done`        | Completed   | Created, Started, Finished |

**Valid transitions:**

```
todo → in-progress → done
```

---

## Visual Operations Log

WebFetch and WebSearch are auto-logged by hooks:

```markdown
**Visual Operations Log**:

- 2026-01-13 10:30:45 - WebFetch: https://docs.example.com
- 2026-01-13 10:31:22 - WebSearch: "query"
```

This is separate from notes - logs capture WHAT you did, notes capture WHAT YOU LEARNED.

---

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
├── tasks.md            ← Active tasks
├── archive.md          ← Completed tasks (preserved)
└── notes/              ← Task documentation
    ├── TASK-001.md
    ├── TASK-002.md
    └── ...
```

---

## File Format for UI Compatibility

The task-memory UI requires a specific markdown format. **See [UI_FORMAT.md](UI_FORMAT.md) for complete documentation.**

**Quick Reference:**

- Configuration section: `## ⚙️ Configuration` with Columns definition
- Column sections: `## To Do`, `## In Progress`, `## Done` (h2 level)
- Task headers: `### TASK-XXX | Title` (h3 level, under column sections)
- Status field must match column: `**Status**: todo|in-progress|done`
- No `---` separators between tasks (only after config section)

---

## Monorepo Support

task-memory supports flexible patterns for monorepos. **See [MONOREPO.md](MONOREPO.md) for complete documentation.**

**Quick Reference:**

- **Option A (Auto-Detected):** Per-package `planning/` folders - hooks find nearest tasks.md
- **Option B (Centralized):** Single `planning/` with domain subdirectories - add guidance to CLAUDE.md
- **Option C (Config-Based):** Explicit `.task-memory.json` mapping

---

## Common Mistakes

**See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for complete troubleshooting guide.**

**Quick Fixes:**
| Mistake | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Creating duplicate sections | Use EXISTING section headers |
| Adding `---` between tasks | Only use after config section |
| Working without task | Create TASK-XXX first |
| Skipping research preservation | Create notes after 2 visual ops |
| Repeating failed actions | Log error, try different approach |

---

## Verification Checklist

Before ANY work:

```
☐ Created TASK-XXX in tasks.md
☐ Set Workflow type and Complexity level
☐ Used proper format (Status field, subtasks, Errors Log)
☐ Incremented Last Task ID in config
☐ Completed Pre-Work Checklist (read files, search similar, identify patterns)
☐ Changed Status: todo → in-progress
☐ Added Started: date
```

During work:

```
☐ Updating subtasks as completed [x]
☐ Respecting phase dependencies
☐ Documenting in Notes section
☐ Logging errors to Errors Log
☐ Creating notes file after 2 visual ops
☐ Following 3-Strike Protocol on failures
```

After work:

```
☐ Ran Self-Critique checklist (quality, patterns, completeness)
☐ Documented patterns and gotchas discovered
☐ Changed Status: in-progress → done
☐ Added Finished: date
☐ All subtasks checked [x]
☐ Committed with (TASK-XXX) reference
```

---

## Git Integration

Every commit references task:

```bash
git commit -m "type: description (TASK-XXX)"

# Examples
git commit -m "feat: add login form (TASK-042)"
git commit -m "fix: null check in parser (TASK-043)"
git commit -m "docs: API reference (TASK-044)"
```

---

## Phase Dependencies

For complex tasks, subtasks can declare dependencies:

```markdown
**Subtasks**:

- [x] Phase 1: Setup database schema
- [x] Phase 2: Create API endpoints (depends: Phase 1)
- [ ] Phase 3: Build frontend forms (depends: Phase 2)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration tests (depends: Phase 2, Phase 3)
```

**Rules:**

- Never start a phase until its dependencies are complete
- Phases without dependencies can run in parallel
- Use `(depends: Phase X)` or `(depends: Phase X, Phase Y)` syntax

**Parallelism Analysis:**

When planning, identify which phases can run concurrently:

- Same dependencies = potentially parallel
- No overlapping files = safe to parallelize
- Different services/concerns = good candidates
